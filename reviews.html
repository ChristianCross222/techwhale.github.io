          <h2 id="iphone_name">iPhone 6 Review</h2>
          <hr></hr>
          <p style="text-align: center">iPhone 6 $200.00+ (with contract)</p>

          <p style="text-align: center" class="iphone"><b>Summary</b>
          The iPhone 6 is the new flagship for Apple in 2014, but is it worth your hard earned cash? We will be going over the design and hardware of the phone, along with software and user friendliness, to determine if the iphone 6 is worth its price.</p>

	 				<img src="pics/iphone2.png" length="100px" width="100px" id="center-img">



          <p style="text-align: center" class="iphone"><b>Design</b>
          The first thing that comes into your mind about the iPhone 6 is the bigger screen. The reason that Apple chose to do this, was because bigger screens were catching on, and Apple was losing customers to Android, because the Android phones have a better design and bigger screen. This inspired Apple to put bigger screen sizes on their new phones, while keeping their great secure software. The iPhone is quite thin (0.27 inches, 6.9mm) and metallic. When you touch the phone it feels good in your hand, but you will be afraid that it will slip from your hand because of its matte feel. You will probably want to get a case for peace of mind and protection. The iPhone also has a big bezel at the bottom of the screen, which looks good, but takes up a lot of room. Another neat thing is that the power button moves from the top of the phone to the side of the phone for easier reach due to the bigger screen size. And the bigger phone is still comfortable to hold in your hand. Overall Apple did a pretty good job on the design of the phone. It is a whole new design, while maintaining that special Apple touch, that makes an iPhone, an iPhone.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center" class="iphone"><b>Software and Hardware</b>
          The iPhone 6â€™s ios 8 software is not that much different than ios 7, and ios 8 is still available on the iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and iPhone 5s. The only thing that makes the iPhone 6 so different is the 4.7 inch screen. The pixel density has not been upgraded that much, so it is still pretty low resolution. The iPhone 6 has a 1334 x 750 resolution, which makes it have a disappointing pixel density of 326 ppi. This is pretty low compared to a lot of the Android phones that have more that 400 pixels per inch! The good thing is that the screen still has amazing picture quality. The iPhone 6 has an all new A8 (dual core 1.4ghz) processor, and an M8 motion coprocessor. They also include 1gb of ram.
          What is good about the software on the iPhones, is that it is powerful, yet simple. This is one thing Apple has always been good at doing with their phones, and even their laptops. It is hard to explain the feel of ios in words, you just have to use the phone to get a feel of the interface. One thing that Apple has never really had with their software is the ability to customize it to your preferences. This doesn't really change with ios 8. the only thing you can really customize is your lock screen and home screen background.
          Overall Apple did a very good with the software on the iPhone 6. It is very simple to use and the software. Software has been the strongest part of Apple's phones. It is the reason that they sell so well (considering the hardware is not very powerful).</p>


          <p style="text-align: center" class="iphone"><b>Ease of Use</b>
          The iphone 6 is very easy to use, whenever I have a problem with it, it always is easy to resolve on my own and I don't need any help. It is hard to think of something that is difficult to do on an iPhone, thats what makes it so special. If you are good with technology the software will be a piece of cake, and you will never have problems. If you are not so good with technology, you still will be able to use the iphone.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center" class="iphone"><b>Conclusion</b>
          The iPhone 6 is a great phone, especially for people that love Apple's software and have always wanted a bigger screen. The hardware will get slower over time, as the software keeps getting updated. If I could rate this phone on a scale from 1 to 10, I would give it a 8.7.</p>
